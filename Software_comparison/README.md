## Software_comparison

This is the main folder of RocketPaper repository!
Here we keep one of the most important part of our work: 
The jupyter notebook that made the comparison of 3 different flight simulators considering the rocket Valetudo!

### Files description:

- /photos :

      A photo of Valetudo and a photo of Projeto Jupiter Team next to Valetudo, for comparison.

- /plots :

      Graphics created using the jupyter notebook "rocketpaper.ipynb"

- README.md : 

      Markdown file describing the contents in the present folder.

      Jupyter notebook used for the 3 software comparison.
      The icon "open in colab" is the more recommended  alternative to run this file.


## More about the Rocket Valetudo:
Valetudo is a high power rocket built by Projeto Jupiter in 2019 and [launched at the Latin American Space Challenge](https://youtu.be/qpMklVJ1a18) in the same year.
The propulsion system was composed by a SRAD KNSB 65-35 class K motor (**Keron**), which was developed and tested multiple times by the team.
