## Bella_Lui_Kaltbrunn
The contens in this folder regards the comparison between RocketPy's simulations and real flight data.
The rocket analyzed here is the Bella Lui, build by the EPFL Rocket Team (ERT) lauched in 2020, at Switzerland. 
To know more about ERT, please follow their website [here](https://epflrocketteam.ch).

## Files description:
- graphs/ :
    
      Folder containing two plots created using the current data. 
      The file "Comparison_EPFL_TitleYES.pdf" was actually presented in the final paper.
      
- AeroTech_K828FJ.eng :
    
      An engine file containing the most important information about the Rocket Motor.
     This files was dowloaded from the following website: [thrustcurve.org](https://www.thrustcurve.org/motors/AeroTech/K828FJ/)
    
- ERT_KaltBrunn_avionics_clean.csv :

      The actual file containing flight data obtained by the avionics system.
      First colunm : Index - used
      Second column: Time not in seconds - 
      Third column : Time in seconds - 
      Fourth column: Vertical position (altitude), in meters, measured during the flight    
      Fifth column : Vertical velocity, in meter/second, measured during the flight
      Apogee at row: 
      Impact at row: 

- ERT_KaltBrunn_avionics_clean.xlsx :

      The Microsoft Excel file used to generate the .csv file with the same name.
      It provides an alternative method to create and plot graphs from these flight data.

- Kaltbrunn_RocketPy_simulation_AVIONICS_clean.html :

      Simple report created when the authors finished the flight analysis.
      It was created by exporting and converting the Jupiter Notebook below.

- Kaltbrunn_simulation.ipynb : 

      Jupyter notebook where the flight simulation was performed.
      The initial cells regarding the google drive mouting can be ignored.
    
- README_Bella_Lui.md :
    
      Markdown file describing the contents in the present folder

## More about the Bella Lui Kaltbrunn mission:
Bella Lui is a modern and robust rocket made by the EPFL Rocket Team (ERT) in 2019.
Since that date, several mission 

Kaltbrunn is actually a city in Switzerland

### Rocket main details:
- Rocekt mass :
