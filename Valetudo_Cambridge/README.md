## Valetudo_Cambridge

The present folder regards the Valetudo flight simulations performed with [Cambridge Rocketry Simulator](http://cambridgerocket.sourceforge.net/). The version 3.1 of this open-source software was used.
For this analysis, authors has used the Monte Carlo method available in the Cambridge Rocketry Simulator, and a number of 3000 simulations was chosen.


- Need to add the file: "valetudo_3000_simulations" !!! LARGE FILE ALERT 


## Files description:

- README.md :

      Markdown file describing the contents in the present folder.

- Valetudo_crs.ork :

      OpenRocket file wih the Valetudo design.
      Actually, this file only can be opened using the Cambridge Rocektry Simulator interface.

- all_trajectories_3000_simulations.png :

      Picture with all the 3000 trajectories simulated by the software.

- ellipses_3000_simulations.png :

      Picture showing the ellipses of impact probabillity.
      It was genarated automatically by the Cambridge software.

- keron.eng :

      An engine file containing the most important information about the Rocket Motor.

- mean_trajectory_3000_simulations.png : 

      Picture of the mean trajectory created using the Cambridge software.

- valetudo_ensemble_mean.xml : 

      File containing the atmospheric details used in the flight simulations.
      It was generated with the help of classes Function and Environmente from RocketPy.
